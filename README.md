The **Error Analysis and Visualization Tool (EAVT)** is a full stack web application for viewing Oz experiment data. 
The Python backend server uses FastAPI to expose a REST API for retrieving, manipulating, and processing Oz data stored in MongoDB.
The React web application uses this API to display the data to users in an organized and interactive UI.
